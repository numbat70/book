All the intrinsic motivators are stable slow burns and do not tend to disappear when you succeed. </p> <p>You will go through phases of being a student, journeyman, teacher, master. </p> <p>True mastery often follows a cyclic pattern as described in the Japanese Shu-Ha-Ri principle:</p> <ul> <li>Shu: Students learn a technique as well as they can. They follow teh rules and take in as much as they possibly can</li> <li>Ha: Students gain proficiency and start to look at the underlying theory, how, when and what-if.    They may start to learn other techniques but they are still following the rules at this point. </li> <li>Ri: The students become the masters and they no longer need to follow the rules. They understand what lies beneath every drill and technique, and can mix things up any way that they need to. They are adapting and creating their own techniques that they will probably pass on to others. </li> </ul> <p>This all makes sense and most people stop here, but now comes the good bit. In many Japanese schools the next step is cycling back into being the student (Shu) in an other discipline. This keeps the learning evolution alive an dwell within an individual and stops them becoming the old guy that says \"I've being doing this for 30 years and I know what I'm talking about\"</p> <p>An even purer form is to start the cycle again within your sport and try to think like a Master and a novice at the same time. </p> <p>You see this in Golfers and Tennis players all the time. They might be the best in the world but they are constantly looking for a Better Serve or a longer drive. They will often take an entire season of poor performances whilst dialling in a new technique. </p> <p>Info</p> <ul> <li>A key point here is that there are often short term dips in performance when you try to improve. This may dent your motivation but the longer view is that you will come out the other side even better.</li> <li>It is important to keep the learning mindset alive no matter how experienced you are at things. The constant intake of new skilsl and knowledge will keep the motivation flames of mastery alive and well.</li> <li>Nature has an amazing capacity for humbling us.
